Lua on Marmalade
==============

This is folder contains the mkb/mkf files for building
lua into a Marmalade project.

The version of lua used it currently:

  http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.4.tar.gz

The lua source is compiled completely unmodified.

The lua.mkb file will build the lua command line tool
and is configured to run 'sort.lua' on startup.  The
results will be visible in the resulting trace file.
